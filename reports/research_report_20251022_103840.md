### 3. Lyapunov-Aware Quantum-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Vehicle Control: A Feasibility Study

**Tác giả:** Nutkritta Kraipatthanapong, Natthaphat Thathong, Pannita Suksawas et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** This paper presents a novel lyapunov-based quantum reinforcement learning
(lqrl) framework that integrates quantum policy optimization with lyapunov
stability analysis for continuous-time vehicle control. the vehicle longitudinal
control problem was formulated as a continuous-state reinforcement learning
task, where the quantum policy network generates control actions subject to
lyapunov stability constraints. the results demonstrate that the lqrl
framework successfully embeds lyapunov stability verification into quantum
policy learning, enabling interpretable and stability-aware control
performance....

### 4. MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial DeepReach

**Tác giả:** Ryan Teoh, Sander Tonkens, William Sharpless et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. in this work, we introduce madr: mpc-guided adversarial
deepreach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. in doing so, madr yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness....

### 5. An AI enhanced approach to the tree unimodality conjecture

**Tác giả:** Eric Ramos, Sunny Sun

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** This conjecture was then naturally generalized
to claim that the independence sequence of trees should be log concave, in the
sense that $a_i^2$ is always above $a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$. this conjecture stood for
many years, until in 2023, kadrawi, levit, yosef, and mirzrachi proved that
there were exactly two trees on 26 vertices whose independence sequence was not
log concave. in this paper, we use the ai architecture patternboost, developed
by charton, ellenberg, wagner, and williamson to train a machine to find
counter-examples to the log-concavity conjecture....

### 6. Search Self-play: Pushing the Frontier of Agent Capability without Supervision

**Tác giả:** Hongliang Lu, Yuhang Wen, Pengyu Cheng et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** To
achieve agentic rlvr with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning llm utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver. the task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. in this search self-play (ssp) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation....

second-, and higher-order gradient-based to zo methods. finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a zo
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource....

### 10. Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Interdependence and Complementarity

**Tác giả:** Vik Pant, Eric Yu

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition
where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture
it. this technical
report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize
two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. we
integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation
and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where nash equilibrium incorporates
structural interdependence....

### 12. WebSeer: Training Deeper Search Agents through Reinforcement Learning with Self-Reflection

**Tác giả:** Guanzhong He, Zhen Yang, Jinxin Liu et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models
capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by
shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative
interactions. in this paper, we present webseer, a more intelligent search
agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection
mechanism. specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection
patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and
reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world
web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more
reflective tool-use trajectories....

**Tóm tắt:** However, bridging the gap between
static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a
core challenge. in this technical report, we present kat-coder, a large-scale
agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing
mid-term training, supervised fine-tuning (sft), reinforcement fine-tuning
(rft), and reinforcement-to-deployment adaptation. the mid-term stage enhances
reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real
software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions....

### 14. A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models

**Tác giả:** Yen-Chi Chen

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** In machine
learning, however, vaes and ddms are developed from a frequentist viewpoint,
where vi is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. this creates a
barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind vaes and ddms are hard to
contextualize without a corresponding frequentist introduction to vi. this
paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for vi, vaes, and ddms
from a purely frequentist perspective, starting with the classical
expectation-maximization (em) algorithm....

**Tác giả:** Jenna Russell, Marzena Karpinska, Destiny Akinode et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** Ai is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published
newspaper articles remains unclear. using pangram, a state-of-the-art
ai detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully ai-generated. 4 times more likely to contain ai-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many ai-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures....

**Tóm tắt:** This paper is concerned with the non-existence of time-periodic traveling
wave solution with speed less than the critical speed for diffusive
kermack-mckendrick epidemic model incorporating seasonality and nonlocal
interactions induced by latent period. thus the critical value $c^*$ defined
in [s. , 55 (2020) 103117] is
confirmed as the minimal wave speed of time-periodic traveling waves....

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. with this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (mpc) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** Disaggregated storage with nvme-over-fabrics (nvme-of) has emerged as the
standard solution in modern data centers, achieving superior performance,
resource utilization, and power efficiency. to address these issues, we introduce
snvme-of, a storage management system extending the nvme-of protocol and
adhering to the cc threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and
freshness guarantees. snvme-of also optimizes data path performance
by leveraging nvme metadata, introducing a new disaggregated hazel merkle tree

### 19. Seg the HAB: Language-Guided Geospatial Algae Bloom Reasoning and Segmentation

**Tác giả:** Patterson Hsieh, Jerry Yeh, Mao-Chi He et al.

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** Recent advances
in vision-language models (vlms) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable ai-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. in this work, we introduce algae observation
and segmentation (algos), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for hab
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. experiments demonstrate that algos achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems....

### 20. Causally Perturbed Fairness Testing

**Tác giả:** Chengwen Du, Tao Chen

**Ngày xuất bản:** 2025-10-21

**Nguồn:** arxiv

**Tóm tắt:** In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing
a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed causalft. extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that causalft can considerably
improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the
cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. compared with a state-of-the-art
approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,
causalft performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more
efficient....
