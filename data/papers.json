    "abstract": "As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to\ntransform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While\nautonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific\nnuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise\nDeep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning\nAgent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents\n(General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool\necosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a\nVisualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism\nthat detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional\nhuman-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report\ngeneration, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as\nvalidated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch\nBench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without\nany human steering.

    "abstract": "Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language\nmodel (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

    "abstract": "Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions\n(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy\nexecution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.\nWhile other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,\ntools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA\nmodels achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while\nbeing 11% faster in terms of steps.

    "abstract": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in\nlanguage models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly\nunderstood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical\nyardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --\nenabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

The\nevolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are\nwritten in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using\nmethods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the\nonly requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a\nspecific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its\nderivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological\nmodel cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions\ndo exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation\ncoefficients.

In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm.

    "abstract": "We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by\ncomparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning\nof vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact\n3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter\nCNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy\nusage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.\nCNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and\nlog loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual\nreasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions\nacross training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for\ndeployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned\nvision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,\nwith an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings\nsupport a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with\nselective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting\nframework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in\nvideo surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and\nlifecycle-aware systems.",

We introduce Car Models in Time\n(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,\na representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled\nsamples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),\nsupporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on\nin-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist\nmodels while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models\nare tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental\nclassification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,\nevolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:\ntime-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental\nclassifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving\ntemporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that\nleverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.\nCaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained\nvisual recognition and generation.",

    "abstract": "Human communication combines speech with expressive nonverbal cues such as\nhand gestures that serve manifold communicative functions. Yet, current\ngenerative gesture generation approaches are restricted to simple, repetitive\nbeat gestures that accompany the rhythm of speaking but do not contribute to\ncommunicating semantic meaning. This paper tackles a core challenge in\nco-speech gesture synthesis: generating iconic or deictic gestures that are\nsemantically coherent with a verbal utterance. Such gestures cannot be derived\nfrom language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is\noften carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot\nsystem that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is\ninformed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention.\nOur method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object\nproperties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic\nmatching module that links these visual details to spoken text. An inverse\nkinematics engine then synthesizes iconic and deictic gestures and combines\nthem with co-generated natural beat gestures for coherent multimodal\ncommunication. A comprehensive user study demonstrates the effectiveness of our\napproach. In scenarios where speech alone was ambiguous, gestures generated by\nour system significantly improved participants' ability to identify object\nproperties, confirming their interpretability and communicative value. While\nchallenges remain in representing complex shapes, our results highlight the\nimportance of context-aware semantic gestures for creating expressive and\ncollaborative virtual agents or avatars, marking a substantial step forward\ntowards efficient and robust, embodied human-agent interaction.

Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate\nShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and\nsemantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents.

In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal\ntrajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based\non the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The\nintroduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP\n(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local\nconstraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all\nUAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed\nParameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on\nthe spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce\nthe number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented\nto verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over\ndeclarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely\non a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated\nplans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner\nexplicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.\n$\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define\nsemantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes\nmeaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models\ndirectly into the search process, $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the\ngeneration of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of\nexisting diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different\nbut semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various\nbenchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ generates\nmore diverse plans compared to a baseline approach.

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two\nmillennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language\nmodels (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic\nreasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain\nLLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal\nintegration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these\nlimitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,\nintegrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback\nrefinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning\nrather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and\nethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive\nknowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based\ninstruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation\nmechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process\ninvolving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for\ntongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic\naccess to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question\nbenchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior\naccuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,\nherb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an\ninteractive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000\nusers globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of\ndeveloping a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning\nand multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning\ngenerative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for\nreal-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a very simple new bilateral negotiation strategy called MiCRO was\nintroduced that does not make use of any kind of opponent modeling or machine\nlearning techniques and that does not require fine-tuning of any parameters.\nDespite its simplicity, it was shown that MiCRO performs similar to -- or even\nbetter than -- most state-of-the-art negotiation strategies. This lead its\nauthors to argue that the benchmark domains on which negotiation algorithms are\ntypically tested may be too simplistic. However, one question that was left\nopen, was how MiCRO could be generalized to multilateral negotiations. In this\npaper we fill this gap by introducing a multilateral variant of MiCRO. We\ncompare it with the winners of the Automated Negotiating Agents Competitions\n(ANAC) of 2015, 2017 and 2018 and show that it outperforms them. Furthermore,\nwe perform an empirical game-theoretical analysis to show that our new version\nof MiCRO forms an empirical Nash equilibrium.",

To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G\nVehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type,\n5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according\nto which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2,\naccording to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions.\nIn the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle\ngenerates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous\nsituation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To\nsatisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the\nperformance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to\nimprove it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase\nthe system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering\nquestions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide\nrange of subjects.

Existing models frequently produce outputs\nthat are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no\nstandardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive\nand developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a\nbenchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,\nspanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse\nset of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally\nperform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for\nearly-grade students (Grades 1-5).

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to inference of deterministic finite-state automata\n(DFA) stem from symbolic AI, including both active learning methods (e.g.,\nAngluin's L* algorithm and its variants) and passive techniques (e.g., Biermann\nand Feldman's method, RPNI). Meanwhile, sub-symbolic AI, particularly machine\nlearning, offers alternative paradigms for learning from data, such as\nsupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). This paper\ninvestigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning\nalgorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata. It\nbuilds on the core insight that the learned Q-function, which maps state-action\npairs to rewards, can be reinterpreted as the transition function of a DFA over\na finite domain. This provides a novel bridge between sub-symbolic learning and\nsymbolic representations. The paper demonstrates how Q-learning can be adapted\nfor automaton inference and provides an evaluation on several examples.",
