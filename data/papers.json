    "abstract": "As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to\ntransform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While\nautonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific\nnuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise\nDeep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning\nAgent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents\n(General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool\necosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a\nVisualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism\nthat detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional\nhuman-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report\ngeneration, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as\nvalidated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch\nBench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without\nany human steering.

    "abstract": "Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language\nmodel (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

    "abstract": "Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions\n(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy\nexecution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.\nWhile other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,\ntools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA\nmodels achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while\nbeing 11% faster in terms of steps.

    "abstract": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in\nlanguage models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly\nunderstood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical\nyardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --\nenabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

The\nevolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are\nwritten in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using\nmethods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the\nonly requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a\nspecific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its\nderivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological\nmodel cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions\ndo exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation\ncoefficients.

In this work, we employ\nmulti-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the\nabove issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to\nanalyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new\ninteraction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that\nis applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance\ncan be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference\ntechnique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the\ntargeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class\nof causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary\ntask goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the\ncorresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance\ngraph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning\nparadigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm.

    "abstract": "We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by\ncomparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning\nof vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact\n3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter\nCNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy\nusage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.\nCNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and\nlog loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual\nreasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions\nacross training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for\ndeployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned\nvision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,\nwith an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings\nsupport a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with\nselective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting\nframework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in\nvideo surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and\nlifecycle-aware systems.",

We introduce Car Models in Time\n(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,\na representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled\nsamples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),\nsupporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on\nin-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist\nmodels while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models\nare tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental\nclassification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,\nevolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:\ntime-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental\nclassifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving\ntemporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that\nleverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.\nCaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained\nvisual recognition and generation.",

    "abstract": "Human communication combines speech with expressive nonverbal cues such as\nhand gestures that serve manifold communicative functions. Yet, current\ngenerative gesture generation approaches are restricted to simple, repetitive\nbeat gestures that accompany the rhythm of speaking but do not contribute to\ncommunicating semantic meaning. This paper tackles a core challenge in\nco-speech gesture synthesis: generating iconic or deictic gestures that are\nsemantically coherent with a verbal utterance. Such gestures cannot be derived\nfrom language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is\noften carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot\nsystem that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is\ninformed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention.\nOur method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object\nproperties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic\nmatching module that links these visual details to spoken text. An inverse\nkinematics engine then synthesizes iconic and deictic gestures and combines\nthem with co-generated natural beat gestures for coherent multimodal\ncommunication. A comprehensive user study demonstrates the effectiveness of our\napproach. In scenarios where speech alone was ambiguous, gestures generated by\nour system significantly improved participants' ability to identify object\nproperties, confirming their interpretability and communicative value. While\nchallenges remain in representing complex shapes, our results highlight the\nimportance of context-aware semantic gestures for creating expressive and\ncollaborative virtual agents or avatars, marking a substantial step forward\ntowards efficient and robust, embodied human-agent interaction.

Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate\nShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and\nsemantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents.

In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal\ntrajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based\non the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential\nDynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The\nintroduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP\n(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local\nconstraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all\nUAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed\nParameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on\nthe spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce\nthe number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented\nto verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two\nmillennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language\nmodels (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic\nreasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain\nLLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal\nintegration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these\nlimitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,\nintegrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback\nrefinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning\nrather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and\nethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive\nknowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based\ninstruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation\nmechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process\ninvolving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for\ntongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic\naccess to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question\nbenchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior\naccuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,\nherb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an\ninteractive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000\nusers globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of\ndeveloping a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning\nand multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning\ngenerative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for\nreal-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and\nprovides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review\nprovides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with\nneural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based\nmethods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation\n(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder\nscalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that\nrely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample\nefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can\neffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP\nin neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for\nbiology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and\nfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological\nlearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain\nlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based\non the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,\nsecond-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how\nthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training\nand the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to\nview biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO\nparadigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.\nThis framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence\nbut also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design\nfast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.",

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity.

In machine\nlearning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,\nwhere VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a\nbarrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to\ncontextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This\npaper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs\nfrom a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable\nsolution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural,\ndeep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.",

A key\nchallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an\nintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient.

This\nrepresentation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex\nspatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's\ncapability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human\ninquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG\nframework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:\nhttps://github.com/aalto-intelligent-robotics/EGG.",

In\nmany real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,\nagents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide\nadditional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are\ninherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP\nleads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.\nMoreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented\nMDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot\naccommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We\naddress these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the\n\\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware\npolicy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \\emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis\non the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of\nimperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with\nOnline Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline\nBayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time\npredictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect\npredictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a\nreal-world wind energy storage control problem.",

This paper provides the model\nderivation, vectorisation and conversion, stationarity conditions, and also an\nextension by incorporating threshold coefficients to capture leverage effects.\nWe show that the GNGARCH is a valid volatility model satisfying the stylised\nfacts of financial return series through simulation.

Our findings reveal critical\ntrade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the\nTransformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high\nenvironmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These\nresults underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility\ncriteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for\nresponsible model selection.

This missing capability could be referred to as\ncultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to\nrecognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its\noutput so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because\nculture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,\ncultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is\nlimited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority\nperspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies\nstrongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging\nmoral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning\non survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation\nmethods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive\nreasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone\nensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning\nmust be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and\nlinguistic coherence.

Traditional supervised pre-training on static datasets falls short in enabling autonomous agent capabilities needed to perform complex decision-making in dynamic settings like web navigation. Previous attempts to bridge this ga-through supervised fine-tuning on curated expert demonstrations-often suffer from compounding errors and limited exploration data, resulting in sub-optimal policy outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework that combines guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) search with a self-critique mechanism and iterative fine-tuning on agent interactions using an off-policy variant of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our method allows LLM agents to learn effectively from both successful and unsuccessful trajectories, thereby improving their generalization in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. We validate our approach in the WebShop environment-a simulated e-commerce platform where it consistently outperforms behavior cloning and reinforced fine-tuning baseline, and beats average human performance when equipped with the capability to do online search. In real-world booking scenarios, our methodology boosts Llama-3 70B model's zero-shot performance from 18.6% to 81.7% success rate (a 340% relative increase) after a single day of data collection and further to 95.4% with online search.

    "abstract": "Consumer segmentation and targeting are essential for precision marketing, allowing businesses to deliver personalized experiences. The article explores the transformative role of autonomous AI agents in enhancing consumer segmentation and targeting within the data-driven marketing landscape. The proposed framework integrates machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to continuously optimize segmentation models, enabling real-time targeting and hyper-personalization without human oversight. Autonomous agents dynamically manage segmentation by leveraging unsupervised learning algorithms, including K-means and DBSCAN, to refine clusters and discover complex micro-segments based on evolving consumer behavior and preferences.\n\nThe AI agents use reinforcement learning to enhance campaign management through continuous feedback loops. By monitoring real-time performance metrics, such as click-through rates and conversions, they dynamically adjust ad spend, resource allocation, and personalized content delivery across digital channels. Predictive models, including Random Forests and time series analysis, further support real-time consumer behavior forecasting. This automation reduces operational inefficiencies, speeds up decision-making, and ensures marketing strategies remain relevant and adaptive. Ethical considerations, including data privacy and algorithmic fairness, are integral to the framework, promoting responsible AI deployment. Case studies from industries such as e-commerce and streaming illustrate significant improvements in campaign efficiency, customer engagement, and return on investment. Autonomous AI enables scalable, data-driven solutions that give businesses a competitive edge in rapidly changing markets.",

This paper, drawing on multi-expert perspectives, examines the potential of AI agents and agentic systems to reshape industries by decentralizing decision-making, redefining organizational structures, and enhancing cross-functional collaboration. Specific applications include healthcare systems capable of creating adaptive treatment plans, supply chain agents that predict and address disruptions in real-time, and business process automation that reallocates tasks from humans to AI, improving efficiency and innovation. However, the integration of these systems raises critical challenges, including issues of attribution and shared accountability in decision-making, compatibility with legacy systems, and addressing biases in AI-driven processes. The paper concludes that while agentic systems hold immense promise, robust governance frameworks, cross-industry collaboration, and interdisciplinary research into ethical design are essential. Future research should explore adaptive workforce reskilling strategies, transparent accountability mechanisms, and energy-efficient deployment models to ensure ethical and scalable implementation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.",

Because agents' actions are influenced by their attitudes toward risk, one key aspect of alignment concerns the risk profiles of agentic AIs. Risk alignment will matter for user satisfaction and trust, but it will also have important ramifications for society more broadly, especially as agentic AIs become more autonomous and are allowed to control key aspects of our lives. AIs with reckless attitudes toward risk (either because they are calibrated to reckless human users or are poorly designed) may pose significant threats. They might also open 'responsibility gaps' in which there is no agent who can be held accountable for harmful actions. What risk attitudes should guide an agentic AI's decision-making? How might we design AI systems that are calibrated to the risk attitudes of their users? What guardrails, if any, should be placed on the range of permissible risk attitudes? What are the ethical considerations involved when designing systems that make risky decisions on behalf of others?

We present Cocoa, a system that introduces a novel design pattern -- interactive plans -- for collaborating with an AI agent on complex, multi-step tasks. Informed by a formative study ($n=9$), Cocoa builds on interaction designs from computational notebooks and document editors to support flexible delegation of agency through Co-planning and Co-execution, where users collaboratively compose and execute plans with an Agent. Using scientific research as a sample domain, our lab (n=16) and field deployment (n=7) studies found that Cocoa improved agent steerability without sacrificing ease-of-use compared to a strong chat baseline.

    "abstract": "The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities, enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm, originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction (HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable, and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing, the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.",
